      <p id="content-get-predictions-to-you">
        Koina is a model repository enabling the remote execution of models.
        Predictions are generated as a response to HTTP/S requests, the standard protocol used for nearly all web traffic.
        As such, HTTP/S requests can be easily generated in any programming language without requiring specialized hardware.
        This design also enables users to share centralized hardware to utilize it more efficiently.
        It also allows for easy horizontal scaling depending on the demand of the user base.
      </p>

      <p id="content-easy-to-do">
        To minimize the barrier of entry and “democratize” access to ML models, we provide a public network of Koina instances at <a href="https://koina.wilhelmlab.org">koina.wilhelmlab.org</a>.
        The computational workload is automatically distributed to processing nodes hosted at different research institutions and spin-offs across Europe.
        Each processing node provides computational resources to the service network, always aiming at just-in-time results delivery.
      </p>


      <p>
        In the spirit of open and collaborative science, we envision that this public Koina-Network can be scaled to meet the community’s needs
        by various research groups or institutions dedicating hardware.
        This can also vastly improve latency if servers are available geographically nearby.
        Alternatively, if data security is a concern, private instances within a local network can be easily deployed using the provided <a href="https://github.com/wilhelm-lab/koina/pkgs/container/koina">docker image</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Koina is a community driven project.
        It is fully <a href="https://github.com/wilhelm-lab/koina">open-source</a>.
        We welcome all contributions and feedback! Feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:Ludwig.Lautenbacher@tum.de">us</a> or open an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/wilhelm-lab/koina/issues/new">GitHub repository</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Check out the <a href="/docs">documentation</a> to learn more about how
        to use Koina.

        <p>
          There are two main ways to get involved with Koina. You can either host an
          instance of Koina to make more open resources available to the
          community, or you can add your own model to Koina. If you want to make
          your Koina instance available via
          <a href="https://koina.wilhelmlab.org">koina.wilhelmlab.org</a>,
          please contact us via
