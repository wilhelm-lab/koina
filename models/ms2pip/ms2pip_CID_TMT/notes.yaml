description: |
  This model was trained on observed spectrum intensities from 72,138 unique TMT-labeled peptides.
  MS2 spectra were acquired ion the ion trap with CID fragmentation (trap-type CID). Raw rain/test
  and evaluation data are available via PRIDE, with the identifiers PXD041002 and PXD005890,
  respectively. Processed data is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7833635.
  Predicted intensities will always assume TMT labeling, regardless of the input modification
  state. Modifications on the input peptide are only considered for the MS2 peak m/z values.
  Prediction accuracy for peptides with other modifications may vary and should be evaluated on a
  case-by-case basis.
