  This model was trained on observed spectrum intensities from six projects, all using HCD
  (beam-type CID) fragmentation and Orbitrap acquisition. These projects contain immunopeptides
  (PXD012308, PXD006939, PXD009925, PXD000394, and PXD004894), and peptides from a chymotrypsin
  digest (PXD010154). The model was evaluated on four distinct datasets with HLA-I immunopeptides
  (PXD005231), HLA-II immunopeptides (PXD020011), chymotrypsin peptides (PXD010154), and
  trypsin peptides (PXD008034), respectively.
  The model can be applied to any peptide, regardless of digestion enzyme, with lengths between
  7 and 30 amino acids. The modification state is not considered for intensity predictions, only
  for the m/z values of the MS2 peaks. The model was trained on peptides with oxidation of
  methionine and fixed or variable carbamidomethylation of cysteine. Prediction accuracy for
  peptides with other modifications may vary and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

    **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Valid sequences lengths are 1 to 30 AA. Supported are all modification from UNIMOD but modifications are only used to shift fragment mz they do not affect intensity.
  There are no limitations to valid Precursor Charges.
  
  **Output notes**
  Intensity was normalized to the sum of predicted intensity value.
  The model predicts y and b ions index 1-30 and charge 1. A maks is applied for impossible peaks (i.e. exceeding peptide length).
