description: |
  This model was trained on observed spectrum intensities from five projects, all using HCD
  (beam-type CID) fragmentation and Orbitrap acquisition of immunopeptides (PXD012308, PXD006939,
  PXD009925, and PXD000394). The model was evaluated on four distinct datasets with HLA-I
  immunopeptides (PXD005231), HLA-II immunopeptides (PXD020011), chymotrypsin peptides (PXD010154),
  and trypsin peptides (PXD008034), respectively.
