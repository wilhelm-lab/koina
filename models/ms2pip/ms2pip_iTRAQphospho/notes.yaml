  This model was trained on 183 383 unique peptides from the NIST "Human Orbitrap - HCD iTRAQ-4
  Phospho" spectral library. It was evaluated on 9088 unique peptides from PXD001189.
  Predicted intensities will always assume iTRAQ labeling and phosphorylations, regardless of the
  input modification state. Modifications on the input peptide are only considered for the MS2 peak
  m/z values. Prediction accuracy for peptides with other modifications may vary and should be
  evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

    **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Valid sequences lengths are 1 to 40 AA. Supported are all modification from UNIMOD but modifications are only used to shift fragment mz they do not affect intensity.
  There are no limitations to valid Precursor Charges.
  
  **Output notes**
  Intensity was normalized to the sum of predicted intensity value.
  The model predicts y and b ions index 1-30 and charge 1. A maks is applied for impossible peaks (i.e. exceeding peptide length).
