  This model was trained on 183 383 unique peptides from the NIST "Human Orbitrap - HCD iTRAQ-4
  Phospho" spectral library. It was evaluated on 9088 unique peptides from PXD001189.
  Predicted intensities will always assume iTRAQ labeling and phosphorylations, regardless of the
  input modification state. Modifications on the input peptide are only considered for the MS2 peak
  m/z values. Prediction accuracy for peptides with other modifications may vary and should be
  evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
