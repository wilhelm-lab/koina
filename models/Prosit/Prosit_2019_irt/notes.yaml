  **Data**
  Source of the data: The data used to train the retention time model comes from the ProteomeTools project. This project aims to provide high-quality reference MS/MS data of synthetic peptides, covering the entire human proteome and important post-translational modifications.
  Type of molecules: The training data represents tryptic peptides.
  Representativeness of the training data: The ProteomeTools project includes a large number of synthetic peptides. The data covers 19,749 of the 20,040 human protein coding genes (98.5%) and distinguishes 26,549 of the 42,164 Swiss-Prot annotated isoforms (63%).
  Data acquisition: The data was acquired using similar instruments, settings and mass analyzers. Specifically, an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer coupled with a Dionex 3000 HPLC system was used for data acquisition.
  Limitations of the training data: The model was trained on tryptic peptides from human origin. There is a possibility that additional liquid chromatography parameters not captured by iRT values may lead to suboptimal predictions.
  False positives/negatives: The training data was filtered for 1% FDR.
  **Optimization**
  Optimization target: y and b fragment ion intensities with charge 1-3
  Experimental variability: No comparison with experimental variability is published.
  Metric: Mean squared error to compare experimental and predicted iRT.
  **Model**
  Interpretability: The model is a black box, However, the model is split into an encoder and a decoder, which means the model learns an intermediate latent space to represent peptide sequences and parameters which is then used to make predictions.
  Model type: The model performs regression, predicting a continuous iRT value.
  Limitations of the model: The model is limited by the type and conditions of chromatography used for retention time prediction. Within limits the predictions can be aligned to experimental values with a subset of the data.
  **Evaluation**
  Performance measures: Pearson correlation (R) and Δt95%, the time window required to encompass 95% of all peptides around the diagonal.
  Choice of performance measures: Pearson correlation (R) is chosen to determine the linear correlation between predicted and experimental values. The Δt95% is chosen to quantify the deviation between the predicted and measured retention times and to indicate the time window in which 95% of peptides are found.
  Single number for performance: When reporting a single number for performance, the R value is used, which represents the linear correlation between predicted and measured values.
  Comparison to simpler methods: The model's performance was compared to SSRCalc and Elude.
  Evaluation method: The model was evaluated using a holdout set and cross-validation. The data was split into three parts: one for training, a test set to control for overfitting, and a holdout set to estimate performance. The model was also evaluated on an independent dataset and showed improved accuracy by transfer learning.
  Independent data: The model has been evaluated on independent data acquired by Bekker-Jensen et al. and on external datasets. The model was also evaluated on non-tryptic peptides.
  **Input notes**
  Supported modifications are cysteine carbamidomethylation (C[UNIMOD:4]) and methionine oxidation (M[UNIMOD:35]).
  **Output notes**
  The model outputs indexed retention time value.
