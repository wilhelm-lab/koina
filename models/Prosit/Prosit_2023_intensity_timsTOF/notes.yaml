  **Data**
  Source of the data: The HCD Prosit 2020 model was fine-tuned using  a dataset of 277,781 MS/MS spectra acquired from both tryptic and non-tryptic synthetic peptides, measured on a timsTOF Pro instrument
  Type of molecules: The training data included tryptic peptides, as well as non-tryptic peptides representing HLA class I & II ligands and products of the proteases AspN and LysN.
  Representation of molecular complexity: The training data was designed to represent a wide variety of peptide sequences and fragmentation patterns, including both tryptic and non-tryptic. The data included a large number of peptides with different amino acid combinations, covering nearly all possible N- and C-terminal amino acid combinations. This was done to address the challenge of identifying non-tryptic HLA peptides, whose fragmentation characteristics can be distinct from tryptic peptides.
  Data acquisition: The data was acquired using one instrument (timsTOF Pro), with a range of collision energies from 20.81 EV to 69.77 eV.
  Limitations of the training data: The model was not trained on peptides containing free cysteine side chains or other amino acid modifications that may be identified on HLA peptides.
  False positives/negatives: The training data was filtered for 1% FDR.
  **Optimization**
  Optimization target: y and b fragment ion intensities with charge 1-3
  Experimental variability: No comparison with experimental variability is published.
  Metric: Spectral angle (SA) was used to compare predicted and experimental spectra.
  **Model**
  Interpretability: The model is a black box, However, the model is split into an encoder and a decoder, which means the model learns an intermediate latent space to represent peptide sequences and parameters which is then used to make predictions.
  Model type: The model is a regression model, predicting continuous values for fragment ion intensities.
  Limitations: The model is trained on two fragmentation techniques (HCD and CID), mass analyzers (Orbitrap and Iontrap), and collision energies (20, 23, 25, 30, 35). It interpoaltes well in this range of collision energies but has not been evaluated far outside this range. It has not been evaluated under different conditions or with different instruments or fragmentation techniques.
  **Evaluation**
  Performance measures: The performance measures reported include Pearson correlation (R) and normalized spectral angle (SA).
  Choice of performance measures: SA was chosen because spectral angle is more sensitive as a similarity measure.
  Single number performance: The spectral angle was used to provide an overall measure of performance, but the distribution of spectral angle values was also examined to assess the model's performance across different types of peptides and conditions.
  Comparison to SOTA: No model was predicting citrullinated peptides at the time.
  Evaluation methods: The model was evaluated using cross-validation (training, testing, and holdout sets), and on independent datasets (re-analyzing data from other publications). 
  Independent data: The model has been evaluated on independent data acquired Phulphagar et al. and Fossati, A. et al.
  Model performance variability: The model's performance is not highly variable. The model shows consistent performance across different collision energies, peptides, and datasets. The modelâ€™s predictions can be calibrated to the NCE used for acquisition.
  Data applicability: The model is applicable to both tryptic and non-tryptic un-modified and citrullinated peptides. It is applicable to data acquired using HCD and CID fragmentation. It is not applicable to data acquired using other fragmentation methods or using different mass analyzers. (e.g. TOF analyzer)
