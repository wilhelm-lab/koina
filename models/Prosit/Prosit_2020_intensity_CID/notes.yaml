  **Data**
  Source of the data: The model was trained using data from the ProteomeTools project. This included both previously published (tryptic) data and data generated specifically for this study (non-tryptic). The data consisted of tandem mass spectra acquired from synthetic peptides. This project synthesized and analyzed over 300,000 non-tryptic peptides using multi-modal LC-MS/MS. These peptides included HLA class I & II ligands and products of the proteases AspN and LysN.
  Type of molecules: The training data included tryptic peptides, as well as non-tryptic peptides representing HLA class I & II ligands and products of the proteases AspN and LysN.
  Complexity: The training data covers nearly all possible N- and C-terminal amino acid combinations, except for peptides with cysteine residues at both the N- and C-termini. The data includes a range of peptide lengths from 7 to 30 amino acids.
  Data Acquisition: The synthetic peptides were analyzed using an ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS).
  Limitations of Training Data: The model was trained on synthetic peptides. The training data underrepresents peptides with cysteine residues at both the N- and C-termini. The model was not trained on peptides containing free cysteine side chains or other amino acid modifications.
  False positives/negatives: The training data was filtered for 1% FDR.
  **Optimization**
  Optimization target: y and b fragment ion intensities with charge 1-3
  Experimental variability: No comparison with experimental variability is published.
  Metric: Spectral angle (SA) was used to compare predicted and experimental spectra.
  **Model**
  Interpretability: The model is a black box, However, the model is split into an encoder and a decoder, which means the model learns an intermediate latent space to represent peptide sequences and parameters which is then used to make predictions.
  Model type: The model is a regression model, predicting continuous values for fragment ion intensities.
  Limitations: The model is trained on specific fragmentation techniques (CID) and mass analyzers (IonTrap).  It has not been evaluated under different conditions or with different instruments or fragmentation techniques.
  **Evaluation**
  Performance measures: The performance measures reported include Pearson correlation (R) and normalized spectral angle (SA).
  Choice of performance measures: SA was chosen because spectral angle is more sensitive as a similarity measure.
  Comparison to Baseline Methods: The model was compared against the previously published HCD Prosit 2019 model.
  Evaluation methods: The model was evaluated using cross-validation (training, testing, and holdout sets), and on independent datasets (re-analyzing data from other publications).
  Model performance variability: The model's performance is not highly variable. The model shows consistent performance across different peptides, and datasets.
  Data applicability: The model is applicable to both tryptic and non-tryptic peptides, particularly HLA peptides. It is applicable to data acquired using CID fragmentation. It is not applicable to data acquired using other fragmentation methods or using different mass analyzers (e.g., HCD fragmentation and Orbitrap analyzer, for which a separate model was trained).
  **Input notes**
  Supported modifications are cysteine carbamidomethylation (C[UNIMOD:4]) and methionine oxidation (M[UNIMOD:35]).
  **Output notes**
  Intensity was normalized to the highest predicted intensity value.
