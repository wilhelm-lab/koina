  The XL_Prosit_CMS2 2023 model was trained using 251,449 sets of cross-linked peptides, specifically those created from DSSO and DSBU. 
  The model's structure was adjusted to accommodate two input peptides and generate both non-xl and xl fragments in the output. 
  The dataset was divided into three parts: training (80% - 198,294 sets), validation (10% - 26,610 sets), and test (10% - 26,545 sets).
  This model achieved a SA (a measure of accuracy) of at least 0.83, which is a significant improvement compared to the HCD Prosit 2020 model's performance on cross-linked peptides, where the accuracy was SA ≥ 0.58
