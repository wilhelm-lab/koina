  **Data**
  
  Source of Data: The training and testing data were collected from various instruments and collisional energies, including ProteomeTools, which were derived from synthetic peptides with known ground truth. 
  
  Type of molecules: The training data included tryptic peptides, as well as non-tryptic peptides representing HLA class I & II ligands and products of the proteases AspN and LysN.
  
  Representation of molecular complexity: The training data was designed to represent a wide variety of peptide sequences and fragmentation patterns, including both tryptic and non-tryptic peptides. The data included a large number of peptides with different amino acid combinations, covering nearly all possible N- and C-terminal amino acid combinations. This was done to address the challenge of identifying non-tryptic HLA peptides, whose fragmentation characteristics can be distinct from tryptic peptides.

  Limitations of Training Data: While the model can attempt to predict for arbitrary PTMs it was only trained and evaluated with a limited set of PTMs.
  
  False positives/negatives: The training data was filtered for 1% FDR.

  **Optimization**
  
  Optimization target: y and b fragment ion intensities with charge 1-3
  
  Experimental variability: PCC90 between replicates is "somewhat less than 100%".
  
  Metric: Mean absolute error
  
  **Model**
  
  Interpretability: The model is a black box.
  
  Model Type: The model is a regression model, predicting the intensity of different fragment ions.
  
  **Evaluation**
  
  Performance Measures: Pearson correllation (PCC) and number of spectra with at least 90% PCC PCC90
  
  Reason for Performance Measures: PCC is chosen as a measure to compare the similarity between the measured and the predicted MS2 spectra.
  
  Single number performance: PCC90 97% on tryptic and LysC peptides 92% on HLA peptides.
  
  Comparison to Baseline Methods: PCC90 of experimental variation 
  
  Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated on multiple datasets covering peptides from ProteomeTools, Human, E. coli, Drosophila and multiple MS instruments Lumos, timsTOF, QE, Orbitrap Verlos, QEHF and QEHF-X.
  
  Applicability: The model is applicable to the prediction of MS2 spectra for HLA peptides with different modifications.
  
  **Input notes**
  
  Valid `instrument_types` are `["QE", "LUMOS", "TIMSTOF", "SCIEXTOF"]`.
  
  **Output notes**
  
  Intensity was normalized to the highest predicted intensity value.
