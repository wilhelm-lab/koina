  **Data**
  Source of Data: "Deep learning the collisional cross sections of the peptide universe from a million experimental values."
  Type of Molecules: The training data includes tryptic, LysC and LysN peptides from HeLA including the modifications Oxidation@M, Carbamidomethyl@C and Acetyl@Protein N-term.
  Representation of molecular complexity: The training data includes peptides from multiple organisms and the most commonly used PTMs in proteomics.
  Data Acquisition: All training and testing data was acquired using TIMS-TOF Pro. An ion mobility range from 1/K0 = 1.51 to 0.6 Vs cm−2 using equal ion accumulation and ramp time in the dual TIMS analyzer of 100 ms each was analyzed.
  Limitations of Training Data: While the model can attempt to predict for arbitrary PTMs it was only trained and evaluated with a limited set of PTMs.
  False positives/negatives: The training data was filtered for 1% FDR.
  **Optimization**
  Optimization Target: Collissional cross section
  Metric: Mean absolute error
  **Model**
  Interpretability: The model is a black box.
  Model type: The model performs regression, predicting a continuous CCS value.
  Limitations: The model has not been evaluate on data not from the timsTOF Pro.
  **Evaluation**
  Performance measures: Pearson correlation (R)
  Choice of performance measures: Pearson correlation (R) is chosen to determine the linear correlation between predicted and experimental values.
  Single number performance: R2 > 0.98
  Comparison to Baseline Methods: The model was compared with the Prosit 2020 HCD model and showed similiar performance.
  Evaluation methods: The model was evalutaed on E. coli  and Yeast peptides from the same data source as the training data.
  Model performance variability: The model's performance is not highly variable. The model shows consistent performance across different peptides, and datasets.
  Applicability: The model is applicable to the prediction of MS2 spectra for HLA peptides with different modifications.
  **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Supported any modification from UNIMOD. Cysteine residues should be carbamidomethylated (C[UNIMOD:4]). There is no limit to sequence length.
  There are no limitations to valid Precursor Charges.
