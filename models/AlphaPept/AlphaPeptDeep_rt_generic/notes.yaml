  **Data**
  Source of Data: "Deep learning the collisional cross sections of the peptide universe from a million experimental values."
  Type of Molecules: The training data includes tryptic, LysC and LysN peptides from HeLA including the modifications Oxidation@M, Carbamidomethyl@C and Acetyl@Protein N-term.
  Representation of molecular complexity: The training data includes peptides from multiple organisms and the most commonly used PTMs in proteomics.
  Data Acquisition: LC–MS was performed on an EASY-nLC 1200. Approximately 200 ng of peptides were separated on an in-house 45 cm × 75 µm reversed-phase column at a flow rate of 300 nL min−1 in an oven compartment heated to 60 °C. The column was packed in-house with 1.9 µm C18 beads.
  Limitations of Training Data: While the model can attempt to predict for arbitrary PTMs it was only trained and evaluated with a limited set of PTMs.
  False positives/negatives: The training data was filtered for 1% FDR.
  **Optimization**
  Optimization Target: Retention time (RT)
  **Model**
  Interpretability: The model is a black box.
  Model type: The model performs regression, predicting a continuous RT values.
  Limitations: The model has not been evaluated on data from different RT systems.
  **Evaluation**
  Performance measures: Pearson correlation (R)
  Choice of performance measures: Pearson correlation (R) is chosen to determine the linear correlation between predicted and experimental values.
  Single number performance: R2 = 0.986 on regular peptides. R2 = 0.958 on phosphorulated peptides
  Comparison to Baseline Methods: For prediction accuracy for peptides with PTMs the model was compared with DeepLC showing comparable performance (R2 0.95 vs 0.89).
  Evaluation methods: The model was evalutaed on Pan human library from Rosenberger et al. 2014.
  Applicability: The model is applicable to the prediction of MS2 spectra for HLA peptides with different modifications.
