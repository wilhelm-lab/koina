  IM2Deep, is a deep learning-based peptide collisional cross section (CCS) predictor that uses a similar architecture to the retention time predictor, DeepLC. 
  As a result, IM2Deep is able to predict CCS values for both unmodified as well as modified peptides, even if those modifications were not seen during training.

  ## Data
  - ** What is the source of the data used to train the model? **
  
  IM2Deep was trained (81%), validated (9%) and tested (10%) on ~1.2M unique peptidoform-charge pairs, originating from three different data sets: PXD019086, PXD038782 and PXD042416. 
  To account for experimental drifts between the data sets, we aligned them by calculating the linear offset (y = ax + b) between overlapping peptide-charge state pairs, as previously described. 

  - ** What type of molecules does the training data represent? **
  
  The first data set includes 718,917 unique combinations of peptide sequence, charge state, and, where applicable, modifications (methionine oxidation, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and N-terminal acetylation). 
  The second data set, described in (24), contains 5,202 unique peptidoform-charge state combinations and features a broader range of modifications, including a distinction between symmetrical and asymmetrical arginine dimethylation. 
  Since IM2Deep cannot differentiate isomeric peptides, the mean CCS value of these isomers was used for dimethylated peptide-charge state pairs. 
  The last data set consists of 437,479 unique (modified) peptide-charge pairs, most of which are non-tryptic, and contain a larger range of charge states (1-6). 

  - ** How well does the training data represent the complexity of the molecular class the model is intended for? **

  The model generalizes well across both tryptic and non-tryptic peptides. Any modifications that are not too much 
  out of the chemical space of natural occuring amino acids should be predicted with relatively high accuracy.

  - ** Was the data acquired on similar instruments/settings or across diverse conditions? **

  The three datasets were all acquired in different labs, but on the same instrument (timsTOF Pro).

  - ** What are the limitations of the training data? **

  Modification space is limited to those inside the chemical space of natural occuring amino acids.

  - ** Were there known false positives/negatives in the training data? **

  FDR filter was set for identifications was set to 1%.

  - ** How might they affect performance? **

  The model is expected to be robust against this small number of false positives/negatives.

  - ** Were there instrument performance issues during data acquisition? **

  No known issues.

  ## Optimization
  - **What is the optimization target?**
  
  The optimization target is to minimize the mean absolute error between the predicted and observed collisional cross-sections.
  
  ## Model
  - **Is the model interpretable or a black box?**  

  The model is a black box, but can be interrogated with methods such as saliency maps and SHAP.

  - **Is the model classification or regression?**  

  Regression model.

  - **How long does a single prediction take?**  

  A million predictions take about 1 minute.

  - **What are the model’s limitations?**

  Modification space for which accurate predictions can be made is limited to those inside the chemical space of natural occuring amino acids.

  ## Evaluation
  - **What performance measures are reported?**  

  Mean absolute error, Pearson correlation coefficient, median relative error.

  - **Why were these measures chosen?**  

  These are common measures to evaluate peptide behaviour prediction model performance.
  
  - **Is a confusion matrix available?**  

  No.

  - **Was performance compared to simpler baseline methods?**  

  No.

  - **How was the model evaluated?**  

  The model was evaluated on a test set that was not used during training and on independent data sets.

  - **Has it been tested on independent data from different instruments/labs?**

  Yes.

  - **Does the model use input from other ML algorithms?**  

  No.

  - **Is performance highly variable?**

  Performance for higher charge states (>=4+) is more variable than performance for lower charge states, because of less training data.

  - **Applicability scope:** What data types work, and which don’t?

  LC-IM-MS/MS data with trapped ion mobility spectrometry. Other ion mobility techniques such as FAIMS or TWIMS are not supported.

  ## Other
  Evaluation on the test set demonstrated a mean absolute error of 6.26 Å², a median relative error of 0.91%, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.996.
  The model was initialized with random weights drawn from a normal distribution (μ=0.0, σ=1.0), and training was conducted on a single NVIDIA Geforce RTX 4090 GPU for up to 300 epochs,
  with early stopping employed to prevent overfitting.
