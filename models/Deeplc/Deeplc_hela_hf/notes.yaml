  **Data**
  Source of the data: The DeepLC HeLa HF model was trained from random parameters on 161 193 tryptic peptides. Modifications for this model include carbamidomethyl, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation. The data is presented in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00602">10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00602</a> and available at <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006932">PXD006932</a>. The data was processed with MaxQuant v1.5.8.3 and the obtained LC retention apex was used as its retention time target. The HeLa cell line was run on a reversed phase column with 30 minutes gradients using standard mobile phase composition. For all details please see the original publication reffered to at the start of this paragrpah. The data was randomly split into a training (137 821), validation (7 252), and test (16 120) split. The validation split was used for early stopping of the model. The data and split information is available <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41592-021-01301-5/MediaObjects/41592_2021_1301_MOESM3_ESM.csv">here</a>. The final model (available here) was trained on the combination of training and testing sets combined, the validation set was still used for early stopping.
  Type of molecules: The training data represents tryptic peptides with modifications carbamidomethyl, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation.
  Representation of complexity: The model is intended for tryptic peptides with modifications carbamidomethyl, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation. Any modifications that are not too much out of the chemical space of natural occuring amino acids should be predicted with relatively high accuracy.
  Data acquisition: The data was acquired in the same lab with the same instruments and settings.
  Limitations of the training data: Modification space is limited and are limited to similar chromatographic conditions (reversed phase column and ACN+FA+H2O based mobile phase).
  False positives/negatives: FDR filter was set for identifications was set to 1%. The model is expected to be robust against this small number of false positives/negatives.

  **Optimization**
  Optimization target: The optimization target is to minimize the mean absolute error between the predicted and observed retention times.
  Experimental variability: The claimed performance is higher than the experimental variability with 1.7% relative mean absolute error (normalized against the delta of first and last identified peptide).
  Metric: Apex of the extracted ion chromatogram compared against the predicted retention time. Other metrics for performance evaluation are the Pearson correlation coefficient and the 95th error percentile.

  **Model**
  Interpretability: The model is a black box, but can be interrogated with methods such as saliency maps and SHAP. 
  Model type: The model is a regression model, predicting continuous values for RT.
  Limitations: The model is limited to reversed phase chromatography with ACN+FA+H2O based mobile phase. The model is expected to have optimal performance for tryptic peptides with modifications carbamidomethyl, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation. It can interpolate and extraplote to different types of peptides.

  **Evaluation**
  Choice of performance measures: Mean absolute error, Pearson correlation coefficient, and 95th error percentile.
  Evaluation methods: The model was evaluated on a test set that was not used during training and on independent data sets.
  Independent data: Yes, the model has been evaluated on independent datasets.
  Increase in identification: It is expected to be be between 1-2%. Specificity in identification and quantification is substantially improved. This largely depends on the proteomics experiment, especially for complex search spaces it is expected to improve more than the previous mentioned numbers. 
  Data applicability: LC-MS/MS data with reversed phase chromatography and ACN+FA+H2O based mobile phase.

  **Input notes**
  All modifcations need to be explicitly encoded in the sequence. Valid sequences lengths are 1 to 40 AA. Supported are all modification from UNIMOD. Cysteine residues should be carbamidomethylated (C[UNIMOD:4]).
