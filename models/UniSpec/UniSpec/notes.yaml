 Unispec is a model trained to predict full HCD mass spectra intensities, containing nearly 8000 different ion types in its output space, including a, b, y ion series, precursors peaks, immonium ions, and other fragmentation, 21 neutral losses, up to 5 isotopes, and internal ions. The Koina version automatically outputs the 200 highest intensities from the prediction while setting any unfeasible ions (given the sequence, charge, and modifications) to have -1 intensity. 
 Peptide sequences are submitted as modified sequences, with modifications immediately following the 1-letter AA where they are located. Modifications are represented with the word UNIMOD followed by a colon and the modification's Unimod ID, e.g., AGM[UNIMOD:35]MGAK. The model was trained for 7 modifications, listed below with their Unimod IDs. The maximum length for peptides can be up to 40 amino acids and a maximum charge of 8.
 <table><tr><th>Unimod-ID</th><th>Modification</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Acetyl</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Carbamidomethyl</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Gln->pyro-Glu</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Glu->pyro-Glu</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>Oxidation</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Phospho</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Pyro-carbamidomethyl</td></tr></table>
 The PyTorch model was trained on collision energy data in units of eV.  The Koina version is set up for the user to submit collision energy in NCE  and the instrument type. It will convert this NCE value to the corresponding eV value depending on the instrument type.
 <table><tr><th>Code</th><th>Name</th></tr><tr><td>QE</td><td>Q Exactive</td></tr><tr><td>QEHFX</td><td>Q Exactive HF-X</td></tr><tr><td>LUMOS</td><td>Orbitrap Fusion Lumos</td></tr><tr><td>ELITE</td><td>Orbitrap Elite</td></tr><tr><td>VELOS</td><td>Orbitrap Velos</td></tr><tr><td>NONE</td><td>Use input without adjustment</td></tr></table>
 Note, instruments QE, QEHFX, and ELITE only work for charges 2-5; VELOS only works for charges 2-4. If you must predict charges outside these ranges for these instruments, just set the instrument to NONE. This  means the collision energy you enter is used directly as input to the model, i.e. no NCE->eV conversion.

 Fragment ion annotation differs slightly from other models because significanlty more fragment ions are annotated. A full description can be found in [a supplemental xlsx file](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02321/suppl_file/ac3c02321_si_003.xlsx). There are six ion categories a, b, y, precursor (p), immonium & residue fragment ions (see Table S2c), internal (Int). There are 23 unique, observed neutral losses (see Table S2b) which can occour on all ion series except a ions. The pattern "^[2-3]" denotes the charge state of the fragment ion, for charge one this is omitted. For example "^2" denotes a fragment ion with charge +2. The pattern "+[1-5]i" denotes the isotopic peak. For example "+3i" denotes the third isotopic peak. If this is omitted the monoisotopic fragment ion is annotated. The Internal ion notation follow the pattern "Int[x]>[y]" where x is a number denoting the start position within peptide and y is a number denoting the number of amino acid residues included in the fragmen ion.
