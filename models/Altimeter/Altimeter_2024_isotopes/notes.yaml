  **Data**  
  Source of the data: The model was trained on the ProteomeTools dataset that was re-processed in-house, including both tryptic and non-tryptic spectra. The reprocessed dataset used for training included spectra from peptides digested with trypsin, LysC, AspN, and those representing HLA class I ligands.  
  Type of molecules: The training set included synthetic peptides covering both tryptic and non-tryptic protease products, including HLA peptides.  
  Representation of molecular complexity: The dataset spans a wide variety of peptide sequences with diverse amino acid compositions and cleavage patterns, including many relevant for immunopeptidomics.  
  Data acquisition: The data was acquired using one instrument (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos), with six different collision energies (20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 35).  
  Limitations of the training data: The model was trained only on peptides containing variable methionine oxidation and static carbamidomethylation of cysteines. Other PTMs or peptides containing free cysteines were not included.  
  False positives/negatives: The training data was filtered to 1% FDR at the spectrum level. Furthermore, spectra were filtered for a minimum isolation purity of 90%, MS1 isotope cosine similarity of ≥0.95, SAGE hyperscore ≥30, and ≤3 standard deviation from the predicted RT after a spline alignment to Chronologer predictions.  

  **Optimization**  
  Optimization target: The model was optimized to reconstruct isotope distributions for each fragment by combining predicted total abundances from `Altimeter_2024_intensities` with isolation efficiencies of the precursor.  
  Experimental variability: No explicit comparison to experimental variability is provided, though normalized spectral angle was used to assess agreement with observed spectra.  
  Metric: The normalized spectral angle (SA) was used as the primary performance metric to compare predicted and experimental MS2 spectra.  

  **Model**  
  Interpretability: This model re-isotopes predicted total fragment intensities by approximating fragment isotope distributions using the sulfur-specific spline method from [DOI:10.1021/acsomega.8b01649](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.8b01649). The output reflects realistic fragment isotope patterns modulated by the precursor's isolation profile.  
  Model type: Post-processing model that generates full isotope distributions for each fragment ion.  
  Limitations: The model assumes isolation windows that can be represented by isolation efficiencies for precursor isotopes M0-M4. Performance has been validated only for HCD fragmentation in the 20-40 NCE range on Orbitrap instruments.  

  **Evaluation**  
  Performance measures: The primary evaluation metric was the normalized spectral angle between predicted and observed spectra.  
  Choice of performance measures: Spectral angle was chosen because it is sensitive to overall spectral similarity and reflects prediction accuracy well across different peptides.  
  Single number performance: The model achieved a median normalized spectral angle of 0.941 on the test set.  
  Comparison to baseline methods: While no direct comparison was made, the model builds on `Altimeter_2024_intensities` and introduces isotopic detail that improves compatibility with experimental spectra in DIA settings.  
  Evaluation methods: The dataset was split at the peptide level into 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% testing. The model was evaluated on the test set and benchmarked across diverse peptide types.  
  Model performance variability: The model shows consistent accuracy across different protease types and precursor charge states. Accuracy may vary depending on the accuracy of isolation efficiency profiles.  
  Data applicability: The model is applicable to tryptic and non-tryptic peptides with standard modifications (oxM, carbamidomethyl C), acquired using HCD fragmentation with NCEs in the range 20-40.
